# sentimentanalysis
Usually we have seen various works on sentiment analysis but none of them have used little short learning technique for classification. We achieved good accuracy results rather considering short data, also the deep learning models applied are generally very computationally expensive but due to our short data we were able to apply them on normal machine. Main purpose of this project is to classify sentiments of a text using few short learning , there are many paper published for sentiment analysis but many of these used millions of data to train rather we have used maximum of 3000 sentences to train our model which makes it easy to compute and is time efficient with good results . In our previous work we applied 10 machine learning algorithms on 2 datasets – SS tweet and HCR but we didn’t got a good accuracy so in order to improve it now we have applied a hybrid model of CNN and Bi-LSTM on 4 datasets SS-tweet, HCR, US airline and Whatsapp chat dataset and thus we have seen a good improvement in our results.
